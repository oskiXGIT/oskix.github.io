# Online security notes

This is not a motivational guide.
Just practical stuff that reduces risk.

Nothing here is magic.
It just makes you harder to mess with.

---

## Phishing

Phishing is social engineering.
Someone tries to scare or rush you into clicking a link or entering your password.

Common examples:
- “Your account is locked”
- “New login detected”
- “You won something”
- “Download this to fix an issue”

If you didn’t expect the message, assume it’s fake.

Don’t click the link.
Don’t reply.
If you care, open the site manually and check your account.

---

## Links and downloads

Simple rule:
If you don’t know why you got a link, don’t open it.

Bad links can:
- install malware
- steal passwords
- run scripts
- log your IP

If you really want to check a link:
- scan it with VirusTotal
- look at the domain
- open it in a VM or separate device
- use a VPN

If you can’t explain the link, it’s not worth it.

---

## IP loggers

IP loggers just collect your IP and basic device info.
They’re often hidden in “funny videos” or random links.

They only work if you click.

Avoid them by:
- not clicking random links
- using a VPN
- scanning links first

---

## Doxxing

Doxxing is collecting personal info and posting it publicly.

Common leaks come from:
- reused usernames
- public profiles
- oversharing
- location data in photos

Basic prevention:
- don’t post personal info publicly
- use different usernames
- keep accounts private when possible
- use a separate email for public stuff

Make it annoying and most people stop.

---

## Passwords and 2FA

This is where most compromises start.

Rules:
- never reuse passwords
- use a password manager
- enable 2FA everywhere

Yes, changing passwords sucks.
You don’t need to do it in one day.
Change one account per day and you’ll be done before you notice.

For 2FA, use an authenticator app.
Examples:
Google Authenticator
Authy
Microsoft Authenticator

Avoid SMS 2FA if possible.

---

## Basic system hygiene

Nothing fancy, but it matters:
- keep OS and browser updated
- use antivirus
- use a firewall
- don’t install random software
- don’t install random browser extensions
- backup important files

If something feels wrong, stop and check.

---

## Tools

Password manager:
- Bitwarden (free)
- 1Password (paid)

VPN (optional, but useful):
- PrivadoVPN

Link / file scanners:
- VirusTotal
- URLVoid

Malware cleanup:
- Windows Defender (built-in, fine if updated)
- Malwarebytes (optional)

---

## If something goes wrong

If you think an account or device is compromised:
1. Change passwords (start with email)
2. Enable 2FA
3. Check login history
4. Scan for malware
5. Remove suspicious connected apps
6. Contact support if needed

---

## Summary

Don’t click random links.
Use unique passwords.
Enable 2FA.

That covers most real-world attacks.
